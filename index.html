        I was always interested in making programs, particularly video games, but I was first introduced to coding when I took a
        computer science class in high school. There I learned a little Javascript and even made a few programs, e.g: a database
        capable of storing differnt values in an array as well as altering and retrieving the data found in it, simple games
        using a system of if-else statements like Rock, Paper, Scissors, a trivia game using text recognition, etc.

        I am currently enrolled in NU Coding Bootcamp. I am hoping to compound upon the skills that I already have to use them to
        make myself more competitive in the industry, and simply because I really love and enjoy coding. I enjoy being challenged,
        sometimes only after I've conquered the obstacle in my way. I am always ready to learn something new and have no
        problem with not being the smartest person in the room.
